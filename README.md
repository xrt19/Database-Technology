# Database Technology - Case Studies with MySQL

This repository contains the case studies I completed as part of my university's Database Technology course. The projects were done using MySQL in XAMPP and focused on:

- **Basic Database Design:** Creating simple database schemas.
- **SQL Queries:** Writing queries to retrieve and manipulate data.
- **Data Operations:** Inserting, updating, and deleting records using SQL.

Each case study is aimed at building a foundational understanding of relational databases and SQL. The SQL scripts provided in this repository have been tested in the XAMPP environment.

Feel free to explore the case studies and solutions!
